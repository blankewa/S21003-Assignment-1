 * This function will receive the name of a file on disk which contains the 
 * data for a graph which has been stored in the form of an adjacency matrix. 
 * The function should read the content from the file and use it to populate 
 * the AdjacencyMatrix provided. The file will be formatted thus:
 * 
 * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

 * I.e., assuming a graph with 10 vertices, this will require a 10 x 10 matrix.
 * 
 * Each line in the file represents the next row in matrix, indexed from 0 to 9.
 * 
 * Each line will record the weight of the relevant edge in the graph. This will
 * be a value of zero (no edge) or a value of greater than zero (signifying that
 * an edge does exist, and the weight of that edge).
 * 
 * The function should return SUCCESS or a relevant error code.
