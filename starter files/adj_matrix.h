 * 
 * You need to consider validation of the edges as you work your
 * way through them. The function should return SUCCESS if all
 * edges were processed successfully. It should return PARTIAL_SUCCESS
 * if only some of the edges were processed successfully. It should
 * return INVALID_INPUT_PARAMETER if all edges in the array were
 * found to be invalid. Your function should attempt to process all
 * edges before returning the result, ignoring any that are invalid,
 * but ensuring any valid edges are added to the graph successfully.

 * This function will receive the name of a file on disk which contains the 
 * data for a graph which has been stored in the form of an adjacency matrix. 
 * The function should read the content from the file and use it to populate 
 * the AdjacencyMatrix provided. The file will be formatted thus:
 * 
 * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

 * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 * 
 * I.e., assuming a graph with 10 vertices, this will require a 10 x 10 matrix.
 * 
 * Each line in the file represents the next row in matrix, indexed from 0 to 9.
 * 
 * Each line will record the weight of the relevant edge in the graph. This will
 * be a value of zero (no edge) or a value of greater than zero (signifying that
 * an edge does exist, and the weight of that edge).
 * 
 * You can assume that the file content will be valid and in the correct format 
 * too, so you do not need to check for this when reading in from the file. 
 * Other validations may be required in the function however.
 * 
 * The function should return SUCCESS or a relevant error code.

 * - A pointer to an Adjacency Matrix representing the graph to be traversed.
 * - The index of the starting node in the graph where the traversal should commence.
 * - An array which will be used to store the output of the traversal, i.e., the order in 
 *   which the traversal visited the nodes in the graph. The first item of the array will 
 *   record the starting node of the traversal (as per the input value 'startingNode' which is
 *   provided). Subsequent items in the array will reflect the nodes of the depth-first path 
 *   that are found beyond that, up to and including the final node that is visited
 * 
 * The function should return SUCCESS or a relevant error code.
