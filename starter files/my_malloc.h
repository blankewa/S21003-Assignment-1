/**
 * myMalloc(): a function to allocate memory.
 *
 * DO NOT REMOVE OR MODIFY THIS - PLEASE LEAVE AS IS
 * 
 * YOU DO NOT NEED TO IMPLEMENT THIS FUNCTION YOURSELF, IT WILL BE DONE FOR YOU
 *
 * You will use myMalloc() to allocate memory in your own code. 
 * The implementation of this function is provided to you and
 * has already been placed in the accompanying 'tester' files 
 * where it is ready to use. You simply need to call the
 * function in your code where required. When you compile your
 * own code with any of the tester files, everything will be linked 
 * together. 
 *
 * myMalloc works exactly the same way as malloc. For example, if 
 * you were using malloc to allocate an array of 10 integers, it
 * would be as follows:
 *
 * int *array = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
 * 
 * Using myMalloc will be exactly the same:
 *
 * int *array = (int*)myMalloc(sizeof(int) * 10);
 *
