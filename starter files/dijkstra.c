/**
 * This function should perform the Dijkstra algorithm. It expects to receive a 
 * ready-made graph to work with in the form of an AdjacencyMatrix. It 
 * also expects to receive an empty DijkstraTable which will be pre-initialised and 
 * ready to use. It also expects to receive the starting node on the graph to commence 
 * the algorithm from. 
 * 
 * This function should implement the algorithm, running it on the graph 
 * provided and updating the DijkstraTable with the outcome. After the function 
 * is called, the DijkstraTable will be inspected to determine whether the 
 * algorithm has been completed successfully. 
 * 
 * The function should return SUCCESS or a relevant error code.

/**
 * This function should determine the shortest path that exists on a graph 
 * from a given starting node (nodeFrom) to a given end node (nodeTo). 
 * The function expects to receive a pre-populated DijkstraTable which already 
 * contains the outcome of running the Dijkstra algorithm on a graph. It will 
 * also be provided with an array (pathFound) into which the shortest path should 
 * be recorded. The path should be recorded in reverse order; showing, from the 
 * end node, the predecessors that lead us there from the start node. 
 * For example, if the shortest path on graph from node 2 to node 8 was found 
 * to be 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 8. The content that would be recorded in the ‘pathFound’ 
 * variable would be as follows: [8][5][4][2]. I.e., it shows the relevant nodes 
 * in the path, in reverse order. This includes the start and end node too. After the 
 * function is called, the 'pathFound' will be inspected to determine whether the 
 * algorithm has been completed successfully. 
 * 
 * The function should return SUCCESS or a relevant error code.
