/**
 * This function should populate the contents of an AdjacencyMatrix based on an
 * AdjacencyList representation of a graph. The matrix will be empty initially to
 * reflect a graph with no edges on it. The matrix can be populated by determining the
 * edges that exist in the Adjacency List that is provided, and transfer / copy those 
 * same edges over into the adjacency matrix too. After the function is called, our tester
 * can determine if the correct edges have been added into the Adjacency Matrix based
 * on the information that was provided to you.  
 * 
 * The function should return SUCCESS or an error code.
