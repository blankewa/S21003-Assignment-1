/* typedef for a list node in an Adjacency List.
 * For node X on a graph, it records details of any directly
 * adjacent destination on the graph which has an edge emanating towards
 * it from node X, such as the ID / index of the destination node and the
 * weight of the edge that leads to it from node X.
 *
 * Each list node may refer / point to another list node after it.
 * This represents the case, for example, where node X has several
 * directly adjacency destinations emanating from it, and these have
 * to be listed, one after another in a connected fashion.

 * It contains an array of pointers to list nodes. Effectively, a series
 * of mini-linked lists, each one corresponding to a node on the graph,
 * and each one recording any of the adjacent destinations from each
 * node on the graph. If there are no edges emanating from a given node
 * on the graph, the relevant list entry will be empty / NULL. Otherwise,
 * one or more ListNodes may be present, representing the different edges

 * reflect a graph with no edges on it. The matrix can be populated by determining the

 * can determine if the correct edges have been added into the Adjacency Matrix based
